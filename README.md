This is simple frontend to google calendar that is used to mark current open get-some-support-chats.

The google calendar url is https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=l7fs5ste4bllsanrtclmbnpvks%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Helsinki

The widget is done based on the article http://alexmarandon.com/articles/web_widget_jquery/

### Usage

Include the script-inclusion as is done in the example file index.html between the comments 'include me'. It should work out of the box.

The 'div' tag inside the include is where the table will be injected. Place it well.
